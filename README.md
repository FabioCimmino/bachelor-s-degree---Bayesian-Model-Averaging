# bachelor's degree: Bayesian-Model-Averaging

This is the project I made as a thesis for my three-year degree.  
The huge amount of textual data on the Web has grown in the last few years rapidly creating unique contents of
massive dimension. In a decision making context, one of the most relevant tasks is polarity classification, which is usually performed through supervised learning methods.
Most of the existing approaches select the best classification model leading to over-confident decisions that do not take into account the inherent uncertainty.
I pursue the paradigm of ensemble learning to reduce the noise sensitivity related to language ambiguity and therefore to provide a more accurate prediction of polarity.
The proposed ensemble method is based on Bayesian Model Averaging, where both uncertainty and reliability of each single model are taken into account.
We address the classifier selection problem by proposing a greedy approach that evaluates the contribution of each model with respect to the ensemble.
